  <p>unexplained disappearnce of people or vehicles. some of these
    people were possibly subjected to forced disappearnce,but there is insufficient information on their subsequent fates.<p>

<div>a missing person is a person who has disappeared and whose status as <span class="span-col">alive or dead</span>cannot be confirmed as their location and fate are not known.
<br>
<p>A person may go missing through a vountary disappearance,or else due to an accident,crime,<span class="span-col">death in a location where they cannot be found(such as at sea)</span>, or many other reasons. in most parts of the world, a missing person will usually be found quickly.while criminal abductions are some of the most widly reported missing person cases,these account for only <span class="span-col">2-5% of missing children in Europe</span>.
</p>
<p>By contrast,some missing person cases remain unresolved for many years.laws related to these casses are ofteen complex since, in many jurisdictions,relatives and third parties may not deal with a person's assets until their death is considered proven by law and a formal death certificate issued.The situation,uncertainties, and lack of closure or a funeral resulting when a person goes missing may be extremely. painful with long-lasting effects on family and friends.<p>

    AMBER Alert Reports (minors only) and a comprehensive 2002 <span class="span-coL">NISMART</span>-2 study (covering children missing in year 1999).<br></p>

    <p>AMBER Alerts are reserved for confirmed abductions, where child is at risk of serious injury or death. In 2018, 161 such alerts were issued, concerning 203 children. of those 161 cases,<br> 23 were found to be hoaxes or unfounded(minor was not missing),92 were familial abductions,38 were <br>non-familial abductions and remaining 8 were runaways, lost injured or unclassified.As of early 2019, 11 children were still missing and 7 were found deceased, with<br>remaining children having been recovered,Notably, even though all states have optional AMBER program, 16 did not issue any alerts in 2018.</p>

    <p><span class="span-col">National INcidence Studies of Missing, Abducted,Runaway, and thrownaway Children</span>(NISMART-2)<br>
    study by the US<span class="span-col">Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention</span> from 2002 comprehensively described missing children cases for year 1999.<br> The study considered a child missing when its cartaker was alarmed for at least 1hour and tried to locate it. THe estimated number of "caretaker missing children(reported and not reported)"was around 1.3 million, with about 800 thousand missing children<br>estimated to have been reported.The 1,300,000 number is further broken down into approximately 33,000 non-familial abductions,117,000 familial abductions,629,000 <br> runaway/thrownaway cases and 375,000 "beging Exploitation". By the time the study data were collected,<br>99.8%
  of 1.3 million caretaker missing children had been returned home alive or located.Only 0.2% percent or 2,500 had not,the vast majority of which were runaways from institutions.furthermore,only an estimated 115 of 33,000 non-familial abductions were stereotypical kidnappings, involving a stranger or slight acquaintance,<br>who holds the child for ransom,abducts with intent to kill or keep permanently.Data in the study was derived from a law Enforcement Study, National Household Surveys of both Adult Caretakers and Youth(telephone interviews)<br> and a Juvenile facilities Study.The estimated number of 800,000 missing children reports has been widely circulated in the popular press.</p>

  <p>The United States'<span class="span-col">National Crime information Center</span>(NCIC) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, mandated by the <span class="span-col">National Child Search Assistancce Act</span>, maintains its<br>
  own"Missing Person File" to which local police report people for whom they are searching. The NCIC"Missing Person File" does have a category that is entitled"Juvenile" or "EMJ", but that category does not reflect the total number of all juveniles reported missing to the NCIC, for whom local polic are seaching . The NCIC also uses its own classification criteria; it does not use the above NISMART definitions of  what constitutes a missing child.<br> The NCIC data is limited to individuals who have been reported to the Ncic as missing, and are being searched for, by local police, in addition, the EMJ catagory does not contain all reports of juveniles who have reported missing to the NCIC.</p>
